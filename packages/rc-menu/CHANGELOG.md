# @rcarls/rc-menu

## 0.6.0

### Patch Changes

- 7382c71: Add a priority-aware action toolbar that moves original controls into an
  overflow menu. Which actions are promoted is a purely declarative computation
  from `max-shown` and each action's `data-priority`/authored `slot`, with no
  runtime measurement of the toolbar's or its children's rendered size: a
  consumer whose promoted count needs to react to available space owns that
  decision and writes the resulting `max-shown` value down. Include controlled
  and uncontrolled open state, keyboard navigation, light dismissal, and a
  non-Popover fallback.

  Fix `--rc-adaptive-menu-touch-target-overlap-inline-start`/`-end`: the host's
  own `max-inline-size: 100%` self-referenced a shrink-to-fit ancestor's
  already-margin-reduced auto size (an app bar's own trailing group, for
  example), quietly clamping the host back down and canceling the overlap out
  from under it. The cap now grows by the overlap amount so it only ever bounds
  the host's real content.

- 30eb232: Add icon-only activation-area sizing and Material icon-button variants. Align menu
  selection and submenu affordances, and keep anchored popups within the viewport
  across native and fallback positioning.

### Minor Changes

- 3e89095: Replace rc-menu's generated submenu glyph with an author-supplied `indicator`
  slot on rc-menu-button. Keep the decorative indicator inside the trigger bounds,
  reserve label space for it, and expose theme-neutral size, color, and inset
  tokens for Material, Substrate, and application themes.
